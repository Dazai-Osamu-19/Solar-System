        <center><h2 style="color: orange;">THE SUN</h2></center>
	<center>
            <p style="color: white;">Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium – at the center of our solar system. It's about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it's our solar system's only star. Without the Sun's energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.</p>
        <center><p style="color: white;">From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers). Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival, it’s only an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many solar systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings of distant stars.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">NAMESAKE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many Sun-related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">POTENTIAL FOR LIFE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun could not harbor life as we know it because of its extreme temperatures and radiation. Yet life on Earth is only possible because of the Sun’s light and energy.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">SIZE AND DISTANCE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Our Sun is a medium-sized star with a radius of about 435,000 miles (700,000 kilometers). Many stars are much larger – but the Sun is far more massive than our home planet: it would take more than 330,000 Earths to match the mass of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun's volume.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha Centauri triple star system: red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light-years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B – two sunlike stars orbiting each other – are 4.37 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which equals about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers).</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">ORBIT AND ROTATION</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun is located in the Milky Way galaxy in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way, bringing with it the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects in our solar system. Our solar system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this speed, it takes about 230 million years for the Sun to make one complete trip around the Milky Way.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun rotates on its axis as it revolves around the galaxy. Its spin has a tilt of 7.25 degrees with respect to the plane of the planets’ orbits. Since the Sun is not solid, different parts rotate at different rates. At the equator, the Sun spins around once about every 25 Earth days, but at its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">MOONS AND RINGS</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">As a star, the Sun doesn’t have any moons, but the planets and their moons orbit the Sun.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming, about 4.6 billion years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun.</p></center>
</div>

	<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">FORMATION</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago in a giant, spinning cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the nebula's material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of our solar system’s mass. Much of the remaining material formed the planets and other objects that now orbit the Sun. (The rest of the leftover gas and dust was blown away by the young Sun's early solar wind.)</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Like all stars, our Sun will eventually run out of energy. When it starts to die, the Sun will expand into a red giant star, becoming so large that it will engulf Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth as well. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 5 billion years or so before it becomes a white dwarf.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">STRUCTURE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun is a huge ball of hydrogen and helium held together by its own gravity.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun has several regions. The interior regions include the core, the radiative zone, and the convection zone. Moving outward – the visible surface or photosphere is next, then the chromosphere, followed by the transition zone, and then the corona – the Sun’s expansive outer atmosphere.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Once material leaves the corona at supersonic speeds, it becomes the solar wind, which forms a huge magnetic "bubble" around the Sun, called the heliosphere. The heliosphere extends beyond the orbit of the planets in our solar system. Thus, Earth exists inside the Sun’s atmosphere. Outside the heliosphere is interstellar space.</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The core is the hottest part of the Sun. Nuclear reactions here – where hydrogen is fused to form helium – power the Sun’s heat and light. Temperatures top 27 million °F (15 million °C) and it’s about 86,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) thick. The density of the Sun’s core is about 150 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). That is approximately 8 times the density of gold (19.3 g/cm³) or 13 times the density of lead (11.3 g/cm³).</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Energy from the core is carried outward by radiation. This radiation bounces around the radiative zone, taking about 170,000 years to get from the core to the top of the convection zone. Moving outward, in the convection zone, the temperature drops below 3.5 million °F (2 million °C). Here, large bubbles of hot plasma (a soup of ionized atoms) move upward toward the photosphere, which is the layer we think of as the Sun's surface.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">SURFACE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun doesn’t have a solid surface like Earth and the other rocky planets and moons. The part of the Sun commonly called its surface is the photosphere. The word photosphere means "light sphere" – which is apt because this is the layer that emits the most visible light. It’s what we see from Earth with our eyes. (Hopefully, it goes without saying – but never look directly at the Sun without protecting your eyes.)</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Although we call it the surface, the photosphere is actually the first layer of the solar atmosphere. It's about 250 miles thick, with temperatures reaching about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius). That's much cooler than the blazing core, but it's still hot enough to make carbon – like diamonds and graphite – not just melt, but boil. Most of the Sun's radiation escapes outward from the photosphere into space.</p></center>
</div>

        <div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: orange;">ATMOSPHERE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Above the photosphere is the chromosphere, the transition zone, and the corona. Not all scientists refer to the transition zone as its own region – it is simply the thin layer where the chromosphere rapidly heats and becomes the corona. The photosphere, chromosphere, and corona are all part of the Sun’s atmosphere. (The corona is sometimes casually referred to as “the Sun’s atmosphere,” but it is actually the Sun’s upper atmosphere.)</p></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The Sun’s atmosphere is where we see features such as sunspots, coronal holes, and solar flares.</p></center>

        <center><h2 style="color: pink;">THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h2></center>
        <center>
            <p style="color: white;">Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</p>
        </center>
</div>

<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: pink;">NAMESAKE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."</p></center>
</div>

<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: pink;">POTENTIAL FOR LIFE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">So far, we've only know about life on Earth, but NASA is searching for life on other worlds in our solar system and beyond.</p></center>
</div>

<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: pink;">SIZE AND DISTANCE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object – dwarf planet Pluto.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">Beyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">The Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away. This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence, where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">The Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind – a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock. This edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">Two NASA spacecraft launched in 1977 have crossed the termination shock: Voyager 1 in 2004 and Voyager 2 in 2007. Voyager 1 went interstellar in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. But it will be many thousands of years before the two Voyagers exit the Oort Cloud.</p></center>
</div>

<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: pink;">MOONS</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Our solar system has hundreds of moons orbiting planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">Of the eight planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons, although Venus does have a quasi-satellite that has officially been named Zoozve.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">The giant planets Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system’s moon counts. In some ways, the swarms of moons around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">Pluto, smaller than our own moon, has five moons in its orbit, including Charon, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble.</p></center>
</div>

<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: pink;">FORMATION</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula – a spinning, swirling disk of material.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of the available matter.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">Matter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons.</p></center>
</div>

<div class="contact-box" style="background-image: url(dust.jpg);">
	<center><h2 style="color: pink;">STRUCTURE</h2></center>
        <center><p style="color: white;">The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest to the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – are terrestrial planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces.</p></center>
	<center><p style="color: white;">Meanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid, or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</p></center>
